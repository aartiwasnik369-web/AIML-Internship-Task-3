# Task 3: Linear Regression – House Price Prediction

## Objective
To implement and understand Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression using Python.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Dataset
Housing Price Dataset (Housing.csv)  
Target Variable: price

## Simple Linear Regression
- Used one feature (area) to predict price
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Trained Linear Regression model
- Evaluated using MAE, MSE, and R² score
- Plotted regression line

## Multiple Linear Regression
- Used all features after encoding categorical variables
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Trained Linear Regression model
- Evaluated using MAE, MSE, and R² score
- Compared results with simple regression

## Evaluation Metrics
- MAE: Mean Absolute Error
- MSE: Mean Squared Error
- R² Score: Measures model performance

## Conclusion
Multiple Linear Regression performed better than Simple Linear Regression because it considers multiple factors affecting house prices.
